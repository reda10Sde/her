			Hello beautiful <br>
			I made this for you I know it's not something extraordinary but this is my love language <br>
			I don't know what to write but I have to say what I feel :\  <br>
			Before I knew you my life wasn't the same it's like I was lost in the dark and suddently you came and brightened my world <br>
			I made a good plan for us (tji l france ) but you didn't want to be part of it ;( I don't wanna wait 4 or 5 years to be with you I don't know what should I do but I really want to formalize our relationship <br>
			I know you're surprised now I've never talked to you like that but this is the real me when I love someone I give my full trust and love. Dooooon't try to break them :/ <br>
			it's been almost 8 months since we started talking and I've noticed that a lot of things have changed in me thanks to you ,I dropped all my bad habits and focused solely on you <br>
			I don't know what else to say but just know that I'm 1000000% serious. <br>
